If true, all tags must match for an image to display

## matchCase
default:false
Should tags be required to match case of the filter
## imgWidth
default: assigned in settings
Max width of the columns in pixels
## imgHeight
default: assigned in settings(default setting is 0 so images use max height)

## divAlign
default:left

## divHeight
default:0
Height of the display block in pixels. If less than 10 it switchs to automatically fit the size of the contents. If greater than 10 it limits the view area and creates a scroll area if needed to display all results
## sort
default:unsorted
name: sort in order of file name
path: sort in order of file name, but grouped by file structure
cdate: sort by date the image file was added to this vault NOTE: in obsidian, files created on another machine have a cdate based on when they reached THIS machine
mdate: sort by date that the image's info file was last modified(if no info file falls back to last modified date of image itself)
size: sort by size of the file
## reverseOrder
default:false
Should image order be flipped
## customList
Specify images to display from the filtered list by their order in the list(not compatible with randomization)
