# Meta Files and Templates
Meta files are where tags and other information can be stored about the image. When browsing the gallery, the info show in the side panel about an image is a display of the the meta file, so information you want to see there should be added to these. Tags added to the file front matter can be searched for and when the meta file is first created it will attempt to pull any existing tags out of the image file itself, though not all formats are compatible with this. 

## Templates
Meta files are built from a template, and by default that template includes a frontmatter section with a tags parameter, an embeded link to the image, an image info block, and a section marked for a description. You can select your own template file in settings and populate it with the following autogenerated fields:
- <% IMG LINK %> : Clickable link to the image with its name as the text
- <% IMG EMBED %> : Embeded view of the image
- <% IMG INFO %> : Info block for the image
- <% IMG URI %> : The formatted URI for the image that can be used to generate a link to it
- <% IMG PATH %> : Path to the image(including file name and extension)
- <% IMG NAME %> : File name for the image
Any other text in the template file will be imput as is(I am looking into templater support, but I have no timeline for said feature)

### Example Meta Template

## Display Image Info block
Image info blocks can exist outside of meta files as well, and can have explicite hidden metadata. if no hidden fields are specified then it goes off of the hidden info toggled in the settings.
As a note, color pallette cannot currently be extracted when on mobile devices, but if the meta file is shown on a desktop then it saves that data so it will be accessable on mobile as well.

### Example Info Block
```gallery-info
imgPath=Art/1332338028.silverfox5213_commission_for_kikiluvi_fa.jpg
ignoreInfo=date
```

Most fields are probably self expanitory, but there are a few here you might not be used to
- Backlinks are links in your vault to the image file the block is targetting
- Infolinks are links in your vault to the meta file for that image file, assuming it has one
- Related Files are files that live in the same folder as the image file, and have a very similar name to the image file.This feature was added to allow creating previews and links for files obsidian does not typically handle(PSD, CLIP, KRA, BLEND, etc.) as well as tie numbered files together(image1.png, image2.png, image3.png)
- Any frontmatter fields in the meta file not marked to be hidden are listed as well, in case you have your own info you want to display
